This project is a Python based password generator that creates secure, randomized passwords based on user defined settings. The program allows customization of password length and inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It ensures strong, unpredictable passwords by using Python’s built in random or secrets module for high quality randomness.
