This Python script fetches live NBA game scores and top player statistics using the nba_api library. It provides two main features: displaying today’s NBA games with home and away teams, current scores, and game status, and listing the top 10 players by points per game (PPG). The script demonstrates working with API endpoints, handling nested JSON/dictionary data, and formatting output for easy reading in the terminal. It’s ideal for learning how to interact with APIs, parse structured data, and create simple, informative terminal applications.
