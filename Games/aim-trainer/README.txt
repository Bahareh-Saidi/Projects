This project is a simple aim training game built with Python and Pygame. The goal of the game is to help players improve their mouse accuracy and reaction time by clicking on randomly appearing targets before they disappear.

The game tracks key performance metrics such as hits, misses, accuracy, speed, and total time played. As the game progresses, targets become more challenging by changing size and timing, creating a dynamic difficulty experience.

This project demonstrates core game development concepts including event handling, collision detection, timers, scoring systems, and real time rendering using Pygame. It is well suited for beginners looking to practice Python fundamentals while building an interactive application.
